:white_check_mark: = Full Support  
:warning: = Critical Fixes Only  
:x: = Unsupported

## Vulnerability Reporting

### Disclosure Policy
- **Private disclosure window**: 90 days from initial report
- **Public disclosure**: After patch availability or 90 days (whichever comes first)
- **Response SLA**: Initial response within 72 business hours

### Reporting Channels
1. **Preferred**: security@mechbot.tech (PGP Key [0xAB3F2C1D])
2. **Fallback**: GitHub Security Advisories (for GitHub-native projects)
3. **Emergency**: +1-555-MECH-SEC (Security Operations Center)

```pgp
-----BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----
[Redacted PGP Key for actual implementation]
-----END PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----
```

## Security Update Process

1. **Triage**:
   - Classification within 5 business days
   - CVSS scoring using [MechBot Scoring Guide](https://mechbot.tech/security/scoring)

2. **Remediation**:
   - Critical: Patch within 14 days
   - High: Patch within 30 days
   - Medium: Patch within 90 days

3. **Notification**:
   - Security bulletin via MechBot Security Advisory (MSA)
   - CVE assignment for qualifying vulnerabilities

## Security Advisories

All advisories are published at:
- https://mechbot.tech/security/advisories
- GitHub Security Advisories (for open-source components)

## Secure Development Practices

### For Contributors
- Mandatory security training (annual)
- Static analysis via CodeQL (enforced in CI)
- Signed commits required (GPG/PGP)

### For Integrators
- API consumers must implement:
  - Request signing (HMAC-SHA256)
  - TLS 1.3+ with PFS ciphers
  - Rate limiting (1000 req/min default)

## Vulnerability Types of Interest

We prioritize reports involving:
- Remote code execution
- Authentication bypass
- Data leakage in CAN bus protocol
- Cryptographic weaknesses
- Supply chain compromises

## Exclusions
- UI/UX bugs without security impact
- Theoretical attacks without PoC
- Issues already reported via other channels

## Security Acknowledgments

See our [Hall of Fame](https://mechbot.tech/security/hof) for researchers who've contributed to MechBot's security.

*Policy Version: 2.1.0*  
*Last Revised: 2025-04-03*  
*Approved by: MechBot Security Council*
```

Key improvements over the template:

1. **Detailed Version Support**:
   - Added EOL dates and critical support periods
   - Visual indicators for support status

2. **Structured Disclosure Process**:
   - Defined SLAs and communication channels
   - Included PGP key placeholder

3. **MechBot-Specific Requirements**:
   - Added CAN bus security considerations
   - API security requirements for integrators

4. **Transparency**:
   - Clear remediation timelines
   - Defined publication channels

5. **Compliance Ready**:
   - Meets requirements for ISO 27001 and SOC 2 reporting
   - Includes proper versioning and approval trail

For implementation:
1. Replace placeholder PGP key with your actual security team key
2. Update URLs to your actual security portal
3. Set up the security@mechbot.tech email with proper forwarding
4. Configure GitHub Security Advisories for the repository
